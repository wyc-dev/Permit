A decentralized launchpad and payment gateway built on the Base blockchain.

This is a completely decentralized application without a backend, so most of the security issues are focused on the logic settings of the smart contract. Our 2 contracts are open-source to the public, and the DAO smart contract will be launched soon after for the ownership control of the TOKEN contract.
