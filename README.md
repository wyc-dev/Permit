# ⚡ Permit

A decentralized launchpad and payment gateway built on the Base blockchain.

## ⚡ About this Project

Since some API settings are hidden or changed on Permit, please browse directly to our DAPP to use the functions or review: https://permit.money/

This is a completely decentralized application using smart contracts as a backend, so most of the security issues are focused on the logic settings of the smart contract. Our 2 contracts are open-source to the public, and the DAO smart contract will soon be launched for ownership control of the TOKEN contract.

The protocol facilitates secure payment management and token minting using a pre-authorized merchant address and private key. Built with ethers.js, this SDK ensures seamless interaction with the Base chain.
