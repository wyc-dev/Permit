# ⚡ Permit

A decentralized launchpad and payment gateway built on the Base blockchain.

## ⚡ About this Project

Since some API settings are hidden or changed on Permit, please browse directly to our DAPP to use the functions or review: https://permit.money/

This is a completely decentralized application without a backend, so most of the security issues are focused on the logic settings of the smart contract. Our 2 contracts are open-source to the public, and the DAO smart contract will soon be launched for ownership control of the TOKEN contract.

## ⚡ Merchants SDK

We are preparing a developer-friendly, simple package that allows e-commerce companies to integrate into their websites or business systems easily. This package will be modified with Ether.js and Coinbase Wallet SDK, and Web3 native developers can also connect to our payment system service through the smart contract address and its ABI.
